# Neopixel

An async server to control two strips of neo pixels.
-It can turn on/off the neopixels
-It can create rainbow animation
-It can create a humming white light
-It can display battery gauge
-It can display speed animation with blob traveling along the strip

Commands are received via ZMQ.
This program needs to run as root, otherwise neopixels dont work.
